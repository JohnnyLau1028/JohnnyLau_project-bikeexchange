															            If you plan to train, pick something with a more upright 
															            position. If you like to compete and get the best results 
															            when training, you definitely need a road bike type with a 
															            lower position.
															        </p>

															            A traveling bike is an easier choice because then you only

																		        </div>
																		       <p>
																		        Endurance or so-called sportive bikes are becoming very popular. 
																		        Not only in road bike buying guides but also on the streets. 
																		        You can easily find a rich selection of different endurance bikes 
																		        which are gaining popularity.
																		
																		        Sportive road bikes are just as lightweight as racing bikes. 
																		        However, cutting corners is easier in a lower position. 
																		        The position of sportive and endurance bikes is more upright 
																		        and it is more comfortable to ride them.
																		        
																		        These bikes are intended for situations where endurance is m
																		        ore important than speed. There’s nothing to worry about when 
																		        riding long distances (or even Gran Fondos) on these bikes.
																		        
																		        Materials of this road bike type are pretty much the same 
																		        as those on racing bikes but they are designed to be more optimal. 
																		        It means that you don’t need marginal gains if your riding position 
																		        isn’t the fastest anyway.
																		        
																		        It is the same case with tires. They are lightweight, 
																		        but they don’t have the advantage of aerodynamic wheels. 
																		        To control the speed, disc brakes are undeniably the best choice.

																								            We can also divide road bikes by their prices. 
																								            It is more subjective but people often buy bikes 
																								            because of their prices, even though that’s 
																								            not the right way to do it.

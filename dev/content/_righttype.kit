        <p>
            If you plan to train, pick something with a more upright 
            position. If you like to compete and get the best results 
            when training, you definitely need a road bike type with a 
            lower position.

            A traveling bike is an easier choice because then you only 
            have to choose an adventure bike with fender and rack mounts.

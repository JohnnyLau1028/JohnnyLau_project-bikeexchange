            Endurance or so-called sportive bikes are becoming very popular. 
            Not only in road bike buying guides but also on the streets. 
            You can easily find a rich selection of different endurance bikes 
            which are gaining popularity.
    
            Sportive road bikes are just as lightweight as racing bikes. 
            However, cutting corners is easier in a lower position. 
            The position of sportive and endurance bikes is more upright 
            and it is more comfortable to ride them.
            
            These bikes are intended for situations where endurance is m
            ore important than speed. There’s nothing to worry about when 
            riding long distances (or even Gran Fondos) on these bikes.
            
            Materials of this road bike type are pretty much the same 
            as those on racing bikes but they are designed to be more optimal. 
            It means that you don’t need marginal gains if your riding position 
            isn’t the fastest anyway.
            
            It is the same case with tires. They are lightweight, 
            but they don’t have the advantage of aerodynamic wheels. 
            To control the speed, disc brakes are undeniably the best choice.
